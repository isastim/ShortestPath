# ShortestPath
A demonstration of a primitive path finding algorithm

Simply run the script from the root directory with `python src/app/main.py --config-file config.json`.
You may need to set your `PYTHONPATH` to `src`.
The `config.json` has 3 parameters:
* The Board
* Starting position
* Destionation position

You may adjust these to your likings.
